[bold cyan]Welcome to the Terminal Scroll Adventure![/bold cyan]

[italic]A text-based RPG where your choices... well, they matter a little.[/italic]

Prepare to embark on a journey through a world crafted from pure, unadulterated imagination (and a fair bit of AI nonsense). Here, the only limit is your ability to type commands and our ability to vaguely understand them.

You are about to create a hero, explore a land of questionable logic, and probably get stuck in a tavern arguing with a goblin about the price of ale.

Good luck. You'll need it.
