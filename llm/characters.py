        "name": "Kaelen",
        "class_name": "Valiant",
        "backstory": "Kaelen hails from the picturesque and astonishingly safe village of [italic]Little-Puddle-Under-Hill[/italic], a place whose most significant historical event was '[italic]The Great Teacup Shortage of '42[/italic]'. He was dubbed '[bold]The Valiant[/bold]' after heroically rescuing the mayor's prized petunia from a mild drought by using a watering can.\n\nHe wields a sword passed down through his family for generations. It has a grand name—[italic]Dragon's Toothpick[/italic]—and is primarily used for slicing birthday cakes and, on occasion, for toasting marshmallows to a perfect golden-brown. Kaelen's 'valiance' is less about slaying monsters and more about striking [bold]heroic poses[/bold] and offering unsolicited, dramatic monologues.",
        "strengths": [
            "[bold]Unwavering Optimism[/bold]: His boundless optimism is infectious, often leading to improbable strokes of good luck. People (and creatures) find it hard to be mean to someone so cheerful.",
            "[bold]Impeccable Hair[/bold]: No matter the peril—a sudden downpour, a gust of wind, a close call with a pigeon—his hair remains flawlessly coiffed. This has no practical benefit but is a constant source of morale.",
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            "[bold]A Mild Allergy to Adventure[/bold]: Actual danger makes his nose itch. The more perilous the situation, the more he sneezes.",
            "[bold]Directions[/bold]: He has a terrible sense of direction, often mistaking mountains for molehills and rivers for particularly enthusiastic puddles.",

                "name": "The Shield of Unsolicited Advice",

                "property": "Can be used once per 'adventure' to block an attack, but will loudly critique your fighting style afterwards.",

        "name": "Elara",
        "class_name": "Mystic",
        "backstory": "Elara's mystical journey began when she bought a [italic]genuine[/italic] crystal ball from a traveling salesman who also sold [italic]all-purpose[/italic] hair tonic. To her surprise, the crystal ball actually worked, but not in the way she expected. Instead of showing visions of the future, it plays reruns of a strangely compelling baking show from a dimension where cakes are sentient and often quite rude.\n\nShe has learned to interpret the events of the show as omens. A collapsed soufflé might foretell a minor inconvenience, while a perfectly executed multi-layered gateau signals a day of good fortune and pleasant conversations. Her 'mysticism' is a combination of educated guesses and quoting the show's flamboyant host, a marzipan golem named [italic]Chef Antoine[/italic].",
        "strengths": [
            "[bold]Uncannily Good Baker[/bold]: Thanks to the crystal ball, she can bake anything to perfection. This is surprisingly useful for cheering people up or bribing guards.",
            "[bold]Vague but Inspiring Advice[/bold]: She can dispense advice that sounds profound but is actually a quote about the importance of properly whipping egg whites. People tend to find their own meaning in her words.",
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            "[bold]Sugar Cravings[/bold]: Her constant exposure to the baking show has given her a powerful and often inconvenient craving for sweets.",
            "[bold]Useless in a Real Crisis[/bold]: Unless the problem can be solved with a well-timed pastry or a cryptic baking metaphor, her powers are of little practical use.",

                "property": "Can be used to get a cryptic clue about the current situation. The clue is always open to interpretation and is usually about something [bold]other[/bold] than what you asked.",

        "class_name": "Shadow",
        "backstory": "Silas comes from a family of legendary spies and assassins, a fact he learned from a pamphlet he found at a career fair. He immediately dedicated himself to the shadow arts, but his interpretation of the craft is... [bold]unique[/bold]. He believes the key to stealth is not silence or invisibility, but [italic]dramatic flair[/italic].\n\nHe is known for his signature move: rolling into a room and announcing, [italic]\"You do not see Silas!\"[/italic] This is surprisingly effective, as most people are too confused to react. He is a master of hiding in plain sight, mostly because nobody expects a 'shadow' to be the one loudly critiquing the decor or sampling the hors d'oeuvres at a villain's secret meeting.",
        "strengths": [
            "[bold]Supreme Confidence[/bold]: He is utterly convinced of his own stealthiness. This confidence allows him to walk into places he shouldn't be, with no one questioning him because they assume he must have a reason to be there.",
            "[bold]Expert Appraiser[/bold]: He has a remarkable eye for valuable objects and can instantly appraise anything from a silver locket to a slightly-used end table. He's not a thief, just an admirer of 'misplaced' treasures.",
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            '[bold]Chronic Over-narrating[/bold]: He has a habit of narrating his own actions in a low, gravelly whisper (e.g., [italic]"And now, Silas slips past the guard, silent as a... well, a shadow..."[/italic]). This has, on occasion, given his position away.',
            "[bold]A Penchant for Comfort[/bold]: He sees no reason why the life of a shadow should be uncomfortable. He will often pause a mission to find a comfortable chair or a well-brewed cup of tea.",
